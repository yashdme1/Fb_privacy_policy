  <h1>Privacy Policy for FB Messenger Auto-Responder Bot</h1>

  <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
  This app connects a Facebook Page Messenger with OpenAI via Make.com to generate automated replies. It is intended to enhance user engagement through AI-generated responses.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Data Collection</strong><br>
  We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store any personal information.<br>
  The only data used is the <strong>Page-Scoped ID (PSID)</strong> of the user, which is temporarily required to send a response back through Facebook Messenger.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Data Usage</strong><br>
  The PSID is used in real-time within Make.com to:<br>
  - Route the user message to OpenAI for generating a reply<br>
  - Send the reply back to the user via Messenger</p>

  <p>No other user data (such as name, email, or message content) is stored, saved, or reused after the automation completes.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Data Sharing</strong><br>
  We do <strong>not</strong> share any data with third-party services other than:<br>
  - <strong>OpenAI</strong> (to generate responses based on the incoming message)<br>
  - <strong>Make.com</strong> (as the workflow automation platform)</p>

  <p><strong>5. Data Storage</strong><br>
  We do <strong>not store</strong> any user messages or personal data. All actions are performed in real-time and data is discarded after response delivery.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Contact Information</strong><br>
  For any questions or concerns, please contact:<br>
